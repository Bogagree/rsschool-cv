    <h3>Briefly about myself:</h3>
    <p>I'm 36 y.o. meticulous and innovation-focused individual.<br>
        After university (MISiS) I worked in a European engineering company producing plate heat exchangers. During that
        period, Iâ€™ve gained experience in goods supply phases, including engineering, procurement, construction, inspection,
        preparation for shipment and transportation.<br></p>
    <p>All my life I've dreamed about relocate abroad, and when my friend invited me to work in tourism, without any
        hesitation I immediately agreed and for the last 10 years I lived and worked in <strong>Thailand</strong>.<br></p>
    <p>Fist 2 years I was working as a tourist guide. I did the most popular 2 day excursion <strong><em>&quot;Adventure to
                the Jungle on The River Kwai &quot;</em></strong>. It was awesome work and good money.<br></p>
    <p>I has accumulated some capital and started own business. But after crisis in 2014 it quickly became unprofitable. I
        again had to looking for a job. Definitely I am a very lucky man because I got a job in a Thai company, where I very
        quickly rose to a <strong><em>General Manager</em></strong> position in a project The <em>&quot;Thai Traditional
            Medicine&quot;</em> (drugs/supplements based on herbs and plants).<br>
        Since the end of 2015, the tourism business began to gain momentum very fast, and a year later I was already
        managing a network of pharmacy. In 2020 the biggest one on <em>Phuket</em> was a <code>1200 sq.m.</code><br>
        This experience gave me the opportunity to manage teams of <code>50-80 people</code> from different countries
        Thailand, Russia, CIS Indonesia and Vietnam.<br></p>
    <p>After the pandemic and the complete destruction of tourism, I firmly decided to start working it
        <strong>IT</strong>.<br>
        Currently, seeking further challenges in <strong><em>JS</em></strong> and <strong><em>FrontEnd</em></strong><br></p>

        Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.
        
        Example
        createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"

          }
