### Briefly About Myself:

I'm 36 y.o. meticulous and innovation-focused individual. After university (MISiS) I worked in a European engineering company producing plate heat exchangers. During that period, Iâ€™ve gained experience in goods supply phases, including engineering, procurement, construction, inspection, preparation for shipment and transportation.<br>

All my life I've become passionate about relocate abroad, and when my frieds invited me to work in turism, i was immeditle accepted that offer. For last 10 years I was working in **Thailand**.<br>

Fist 2 years I was working as a tourist guide. I did the most popular 2 day excursion **_\"Adventure to the Jungle on The River Kwai \"_**. It was awesome work and good money.<br>

I has accumulated some capital and started own business. But after crisis in 2014 it quickly became unprofitable. I again had to looking for a job. Definitely I am a very lucky man because I got a job in a Thai company, where I very quickly rose to a **_ General Manager_**  position in a project The Thai Traditional Medicine (drugs/supplements based on herbs and plants).<br>
Since the end of 2015, the tourism business began to gain momentum very fast, and a year later I was already managing a network of pharmacy. In 2020 the biggest one on _Phuket_ was a 1200 sq.m.<br>
This experience gave me the opportunity to manage teams of 50-80 people from different countries Thailand, Russia, CIS Indonesia and Vietnam.<br>

After the pandemic and the complete destruction of tourism, I firmly decided to start working at **IT**.<br>
Currently, seeking further challenges in **_JS_** and **_FrontEnd_**<br>
