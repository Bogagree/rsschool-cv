Meticulous and innovation-focused individual, from 2008 till 2011 I was working in an engineering company producing plate heat exchangers. During that period, Iâ€™ve gained experience in goods supply phases, including engineering, procurement, construction, inspection, preparation for shipment and transportation. For last 10 years I was working in Thailand as a General Manager in project Thai Traditional Medicine (drugs/supplements based on herbs and plants). This project gave me the opportunity to manage teams 50-80 people from different countries Thailand, Russia, Indonesia and Vietnam.
