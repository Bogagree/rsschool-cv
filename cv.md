### Briefly about myself:

I'm 36 y.o. meticulous and innovation-focused individual.<br>
After university (MISiS) I worked in a European engineering company producing plate heat exchangers. During that period, Iâ€™ve gained experience in goods supply phases, including engineering, procurement, construction, inspection, preparation for shipment and transportation.<br>

All my life I've dreamed about relocate abroad, and when my friend invited me to work in tourism, without any hesitation I immediately agreed and for the last 10 years I lived and worked in **Thailand**.<br>

Fist 2 years I was working as a tourist guide. I did the most popular 2 day excursion **_\"Adventure to the Jungle on The River Kwai \"_**. It was awesome work and good money.<br>

I has accumulated some capital and started own business. But after crisis in 2014 it quickly became unprofitable. I again had to looking for a job. Definitely I am a very lucky man because I got a job in a Thai company, where I very quickly rose to a **_General Manager_**  position in a project The _\"Thai Traditional Medicine\"_ (drugs/supplements based on herbs and plants).<br>
Since the end of 2015, the tourism business began to gain momentum very fast, and a year later I was already managing a network of pharmacy. In 2020 the biggest one on _Phuket_ was a `1200 sq.m.`<br>
This experience gave me the opportunity to manage teams of `50-80 people` from different countries Thailand, Russia, CIS Indonesia and Vietnam.<br>

After the pandemic and the complete destruction of tourism, I firmly decided to start working it **IT**.<br>
Currently, seeking further challenges in **_JS_** and **_FrontEnd_**<br>

![CodeWars](https://github.com/Bogagree/rsschool-cv/blob/gh-pages/CodeWars.jpg) [7kuy ðŸš© What is the flag?](https://www.codewars.com/kata/61efc02e4fd88600343b5c58)<br>

- The flag is hidden in the string variable FLAG
- The flag is in the format FLAG{CAPITAL-LETTERS-WITH-HYPHEN}
- The flag couldn't be found from the string literal right away... 
- but You can indeed see it somehow!
- A magic number 16 might help... but how should it be used?<br>

```
